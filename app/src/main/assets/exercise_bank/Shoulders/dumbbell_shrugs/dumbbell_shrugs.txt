Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and a dumbbell in each hand.
Keep your arms extended and by your sides and with your palms facing in.
Relax your shoulders so they hang as low as possible.
Raise the dumbbells by slowly lifting your shoulders in a shrugging motion. Hold for a count of one.
Slowly relax your shoulders to return to the start position.
Repeat.
