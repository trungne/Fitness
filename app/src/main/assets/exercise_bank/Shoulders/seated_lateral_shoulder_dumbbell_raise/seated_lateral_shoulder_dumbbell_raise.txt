Sit on a bench, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Your hands should be at your sides.
Maintain a flat back and tight core. Look straight ahead during the movement.
Be sure to maintain a slight bend in your elbows at all times.
Extend your arms out to the side and guide the weight up. Your arms should come to parallel with the floor.
Pause, slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Repeat.
