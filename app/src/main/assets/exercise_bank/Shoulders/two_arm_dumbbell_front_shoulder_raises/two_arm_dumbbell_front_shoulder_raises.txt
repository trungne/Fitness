Holding a pair of dumbbells with an overhand grip, stand tall with your chest up and core braced.
Begin by lifting the dumbbells in front of you. Keep the abdominals contracted as you raise the dumbbells. Feel the contraction in the shoulder muscles.
Once the dumbbells reach shoulder height, pause and slowly lower the dumbbells to the starting position.
