Sit on a leg extension machine and place your  legs under the pad with your feet pointed forward. The pad should rest on your shins just above your feet and you will need to adjust it to suit.
Grip the hand bars (if fitted) firmly. This is the start position.
Using  only your quadriceps, fully extend your legs exhaling as you do so. Hold for a count of one.
Return to the start position in a smooth movement as you inhale,.
The angle at your knee should not go past 90-degrees.
Repeat.
