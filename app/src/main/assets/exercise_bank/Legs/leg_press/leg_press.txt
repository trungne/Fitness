Sit down on a leg press machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at shoulder width.
Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform  and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you bot do NOT lock your knees. Your torso and legs should be at a 90degree angle to each other. This is the start position.
Inhaling, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs form a 90-degree angle. Pause for a count of one,
Return to the starting position by pushing through the heels of your feet, engaging your quadriceps. Exhale as you do so.
Repeat.
