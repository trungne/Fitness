Place an exercise step or something similar on the floor in front of you. It should be two or three inches high.
Holding a dumbbell in each hand, place your toes and the balls of your feet on the step. Make sure the arches of your feet are not on the step and your heels are on the floor.
Raise your heels as high as possible by pushing through the balls of your feet and toes while extending your ankles. Hold for a count of one.
Return to the starting position by bending your ankles until you feel a stretch in your calves.
Repeat.
