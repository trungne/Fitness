Sitting on a calf raise machine, position your upper thighs under the top pad. The pad should be resting just above your knees.
Place the balls of your feet on the foot plate.
Keeping the balls of you feet in position, lower your heels as far as possible.
Slowly raise your heels as if standing on your toes. Continue as far as possible until you feel a stretch in your lower calves. Hold for a count of one.
Slowly lower your heels back to the starting position and repeat.
