Stand with your feet hip width apart. Your toes should be pointing straight ahead or only slightly outward.
Cross your arms in front of your body, place your hands behind your head or at the sides of your head.
Keep your weight on your heels and bend your knees while lowering your hips towards the ground as if you are sitting down on a chair.
Keep your back straight at all times.
Continue until you feel a slight stretch in your quadriceps. Do not let your knees extend out beyond the level of your toes.
Pause for a count of one.
In an explosive movement, drive down through your heels pushing yourself up of the floor with your quads.
At the same time extend our arms out above you.
Land with your knees slightly bent to absorb the impact.
Repeat
