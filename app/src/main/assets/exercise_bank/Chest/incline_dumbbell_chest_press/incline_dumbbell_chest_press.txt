Set up an incline bench so the back rest is at about a 45 degree angle.
Hold a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip. (Palms facing away from you)
Sit on the bench with your feet flat on the floor and your back and shoulders pressed firmly back against the back rest.
Raise the dumbbells up to your shoulder level, keeping your elbows bent at 90 degrees.
Push the dumbbells up and away from you using your shoulders and chest while straightening your arms.
Continue raising the dumbbells until your arms are straight and the dumbbells are suspended above your chest. Hold for a count of one.
Lower the dumbbells back towards your chest by relaxing your chest and shoulders while bending your elbows.
Hold for a count of one
