Set up a preacher curl bench making sure that the seat is set at the right height for you. The seat shouldnâ€™t be so low that you need to raise your shoulders, or so high that you need to lean over the support pad.
Rest you arms on the support pad with your triceps near the top and your elbows midway down the pad.
Grip the EZ curl bar with an underhand grip at shoulder width.
Curl the bar in towards your chin and upper chest in a single smooth arc. Hold for a count of one.
Lower the bar by extending your arms back to the starting position.
