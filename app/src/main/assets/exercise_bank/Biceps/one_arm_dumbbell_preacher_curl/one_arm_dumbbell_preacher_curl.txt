Set up a preacher curl bench making sure that the seat is set at the right height for you. The seat shouldnâ€™t be so low that you need to raise your shoulders, or so high that you need to lean over the support pad.
Rest you arm on the support pad with your triceps near the top and your elbow midway down the pad.
Grip the dumbbell with an underhand grip at shoulder width.
Curl the dumbbell in towards your chin and upper chest in a single smooth arc. Hold for a count of one while squeezing your biceps.
Lower the dumbbell by extending your arms back to the starting position.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions then change to your other arm.
