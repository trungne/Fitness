Stand up straight, holding a pair of dumbbells.
Curl the left dumbbell up, pausing midway to your shoulder, and holding it there.
Now curl the right dumbbell all the way to the top of the movement.
Complete half the set with the right arm then switch. Hold your right dumbbell at midway while curling all the way up with your left.
Switch again with both sides to finish the set.
