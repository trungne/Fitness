Seat yourself at a Row Machine and select the appropriate weight. Sit up straight with a tight core. Reach forward and take an overhand grip on the bar in front of you. Activate your lats before the movement.
Pull the bar towards you, emphasizing the lat movement. Pause when the bar is at your sides and squeeze your back.
Slowly, return the bar to the starting position but do not set it down. Repeat the movement, ensuring your back is activated throughout.
